# Titanic-Classification


Introduction

               Random Forest is a supervised learning Algorithm. It creates decision trees on randomly selected data samples, get prediction form each tree and selects the best solution by means of voting.

                       I will go through the whole process of creating a machine learning model on the famous Titanic dataset, which is used by many people all over the world. It provides information on the fate of passengers on the Titanic, summarized according to economic status (class), sex, age and survival.
                       
Challenge
                       
                       Predict whether a passenger on the titanic would have been survived or not.
